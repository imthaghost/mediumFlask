										>How to Delegate Work So It Actually Gets Done
									</a>
								</h3>
								<div class="entry-excerpt">
									<p class="entry-tit">
										 Like many founders, when I started my first business, I was new to managing people. I loved getting stuff done and getting my hands dirty, so the idea of delegating work to others was unnatural. I’d always rather do it myself.

When I did have to delegate, it often left me feeling frustrated. I’d find out later that the work hadn’t turned out as I’d expected, or it wasn’t even close to completion. I took it personally, and it weighed on my mind. I felt that if I wanted something done right, I had to do it myself. And as my workload increased, I rapidly approached burnout.

THE PROBLEM WITH MY APPROACH
A few years ago, I realized I had been delegating all wrong. At the time, I had been in the process of hiring a senior marketer and had asked our office manager to research recruiting agencies, get in touch with each of them, and report back to me.

A couple of days later, the office manager gave me an update: He’d emailed several agencies, but most of them hadn’t responded. My heart sank. This didn’t help me one bit.

“Did you follow up with a phone call?” I asked.

“Sorry,” he replied. “I’ve only got limited time available. I just have too many other priorities.”

Later, I reflected on this situation with a mentor. The manager had done what I’d told him to do. Yet, here I was, frustrated and knowing that somehow the way I delegated wasn’t working out for me. My mentor then gave me some wise advice that has totally changed the way I assign projects.

DELEGATE PROBLEMS, NOT TASKS
When you’re in execution mode, you naturally think in terms of critical tasks, but good delegation requires you to think in terms of outcomes. I realized that theproblemof filling my calendar with qualified candidates hadn’t been explicitly delegated — just the task of contacting recruiters. But if that specific problem had been assigned to be solved, I could’ve been on my way to interviewing and hiring the right person for the job.

The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being micromanaged.

Once you identify the core problem to delegate, check that it actually solves your problem. For example, interviewing candidates throughout the following week would have given me a scheduling problem. What I really wanted was to set aside a single morning for interviews.

COACH, DON’T INSTRUCT
Delegating problems is only the first step. The next part is even more important: to help the person you’re delegating to findtheirsolution. The job of a coach is to help others work through their problems and find their own solutions. When I started coaching founders, I learned some great people-management techniques that I wish I’d known earlier in my career.

The simplest and most relevant one is the GROW framework, created by Sir John Whitmore. Here’s how to use the GROW model when delegating problems:

1. GOAL: ESTABLISH THE GOAL
Once you’ve delegated the problem, ask your employee to explain what a good result would look and feel like. Answer any questions they ask to help them understand what outcomes would resolve the problem. Once the goal is clear, make sure they write it down.

2. REALITY: EXAMINE THE CURRENT REALITY
Before jumping into solutions, allow your employee to get a handle on the situation. Use the following questions:

 * Where are we now in relation to the goal?
 * What’s working and what isn’t working?
 * Is anything stopping you from making progress?

3. OPTIONS: EXPLORE THE OPTIONS
Next, you want to help your employee examine different options that could address the problem. Pose questions like:

 * What are your options?
 * What else could you do?
 * Who do you know who has encountered a similar situation?

As with any brainstorm, don’t shoot down any options just yet.

4. WILL: ESTABLISH THE WILL
Finally, get a commitment from the employee and help them map out their next steps. Again, let them come up with solutions by asking questions:

 * What do you think you need to do right now?
 * How will you know when you have done it?
 * What resources can help you?

Scaling your business requires effective delegation. As you grow your company, the need to adopt a coaching relationship with your direct reports intensifies. The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being micromanaged. This is especially true ifyou’re hiring people who are better than you [https://medium.dave-bailey.com/what-stops-startups-hiring-a-players-785cfbf6040f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=4c8f2636f5284d7b34699d3fd41bbc95].

Effective delegation is also great for keeping your employees motivated. Solving problems helps people connect with their purpose, learn new things, and stay in control of their own destiny.

									</a>
								</h3>
								<div class="entry-excerpt">
									<p class="entry-tit">
										 A hot topic in recent years is whether PHP is losing its leading position or even going to its end. After all, many internet companies are trying out other languages. Some languages draw our attention greatly. Golang is well known for the coroutine. Java is best for the perfect ecological system. And Python is skilled in computing and artificial intelligence. But surely, PHP won’t go to its grave.

We will analyze it in the following sections:

 * The Development of PHP
 * PHP Frameworks
 * Packagist

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHP
PHP is always heading forward. Many excellent programmers devote themselves to PHP’s development. As a result, a new version of PHP is released almost every year. The version of 7.3 was released in 2018, and the 7.4 will come out at the end of 2019.

[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/php1-07e2.jpeg]

The development of PHP is amazing. 7.0 reconstructs the kernel of PHP. And the performance of PHP is boosted by two to three times as the new zend engine is added.

[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/php2-1e2c.jpeg]

PHP FRAMEWORKS
Whether a language is strong enough or not is closely related to its framework. There are frameworks, such as Laravel and Yii, which have been developers’ favorites for many years and projects. Meanwhile, Swoft, though a new framework, attracts our attention and motives us to study it.

LARAVEL
[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/laravel-2bc0.jpeg]

Laravel [https://github.com/laravel/laravel]is a PHP-based web framework for building high-end web applications using its significant and graceful syntaxes. It comes with a strong collection of tools and provides application architecture. Moreover, it includes various characteristics of technologies like ASP.NET MVC, CodeIgniter, Ruby on Rails, and many more. This is an open source framework.

It facilitates developers by saving time and helps reduce thinking and planning when developing an entire website from scratch. Along with that, Laravel also assists in introducing basic security to your application.

Hence, all its features can boost your web development pace. If anyone is familiar with the basics of PHP along with some intermediate PHP scripting, then Laravel can craft your work more easily.

Resources for learning:

 * Laravel 5.4 from Scratch (Laracasts)
 * Build a task list with Laravel and Vue

YII
[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/yii-9326.jpeg]

Yii [https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2]is a generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web applications using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching support, it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web services, and so on.

SWOFT
[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/swoft-a125.jpeg]

Swoft [https://github.com/swoft-cloud/swoft]is a PHP high-performance microservice coroutine framework. It has been published for many years and has become the best choice for PHP. It can be like Go, a built-in coroutine web server and common coroutine client, and is resident in memory, independent of traditional PHP-FPM. There are similar Go language operations, similar to the Spring Cloud framework flexible annotations.

PACKAGIST
One way to find out whether the industry still likes PHP is looking into its ecological system: the packagist. As the below figure shows, the number of packagists for PHP has mushroomed with an index growth pattern. By now, the number of packagists has reached 223,217, and the total install number is around 14,827,204,847. The ecological system of PHP is reconstructing faster and faster.

CONCLUSION
PHP won’t step into its grave. You should take a look at it, and think about it carefully.

										>The Most Underrated Productivity Technique Is Also the Simplest
									</a>
								</h3>
								<div class="entry-excerpt">
									<p class="entry-tit">
										 It’s not humanly possible to read every piece of productivity advice that exists, but I think I’ve come close. And at one point or another, I’ve tried most of that advice for myself, no matter how unpleasant or out-there it seemed. There was a time when I took cold showers because I heard it would help me combat procrastination. (It did not.)

Eventually, there came a moment when I realized that studying all these time-management hacks and calendar systems and multistep strategies was only stalling me from the real work of actually getting things done. I already knew the most powerful productivity technique. It was just a matter of using it.

There are only two steps:

 1. Physically get in your work position.
 2. Do one small thing.

That’s it. That’s the whole thing.

It’s simple, but it isn’t easy. Oftentimes, we do everything in our power to avoid that first step. We grab another cup of coffee, go for a walk, read a book, run errands. Before I wrote this piece, I meticulously rearranged my bookshelf. I tried to escape. The voice inside my head told me to turn on Netflix.

But instead, I sat down at my desk. I put my phone away and closed my internet browser. And I started working on theone small thing [https://dariusforoux.com/one-thing/]that I scheduled for the day. Then, like magic, I was working.

The real secret of this technique is that you must do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. Build up momentum and keep it. Author Will Durant may have said it best when he wrote, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

It’s theNon-Zero Day principle [https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/]: Just do one thing every day that will help you move toward your goal. As Reddit user ryans01 wrote ina post [https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/]that inspired the movement, “Didn’t do anything all fucking day and it’s 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One push up. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero.”

We can talk about the newest productivity systems all day, but doing so won’t get the real work done. At some point, you have to sit in your chair and just get started.

										 MY FIANCE FOUND ME THROUGH A HASHTAG ON INSTAGRAM — BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
Technology has revolutionized humanity right down to the most primitive task of finding a mate. Withapps like Tinder [https://onezero.medium.com/teaching-a-robot-to-like-27c5e8bf6f0], happily ever after is possibly just a swipe and an awkward meeting away.

But what happens when couples find themselves in unconventional predicaments? Such was my case when I began exchanging messages with Mostafa on Instagram. We found each other through my very amateur nature picture I had hashtagged #Germany, so our initial messages were in German. His native language is Arabic and mine is English. We didn’t have a shared fluent language, so after a month of discombobulated Google Translate exchanges, we met for coffee and awkwardness. In true American fashion, my bilingual skills only extended to ordering food despite making my home in Germany. Since Mostafa was already fluent in German, it became our middle ground.

There are also vast cultural differences that required research for me to better understand Mostafa. From traditions to religion, so much about him was a mystery to me. Having crossed paths in a country foreign to both of us, we were on neutral ground when it came to what “normal” was to each of us. Our journey together began and progressed because of technology.

Having always taken for granted my luxury of free movement in the world, my perspective was dramatically altered by the reality that Mostafa and I don’t have the ability to visit each other’s home countries. He’s from Syria, which effectively renders him blacklisted from entering the United States. For obvious reasons, we are also unable to visit Syria together. While we wait for technology to fix wars and terrible policy by fostering communication and civilized advancement in leadership, Google Earth offers an aerial view for us to reminisce with each other and conduct virtual tours together. I won’t be able to introduce him to the exciting world of Walmart superstores just yet, but harnessing satellite technology makes for a fulfilling Saturday date night.

Progressing together on the linguistic front included many hours spent frantically typing into translator apps to keep the serious conversation flowing. My German improved through everyday interaction with Mostafa. He also leveled up in English via our hybrid German/English discussions. Somewhere in the mix, he began teaching me basic Arabic.

Enter the magic of YouTube and the bevy of language courses available for absolutely free. These resources allowed for our comically formal sweet-nothing texts to take a more conversational tone. Gone were the days he reminded me by text, “Hello darling, he is now putting clothing on his body and will lovingly operate a motor vehicle to your location,” to let me know he was driving to me. My response of, “This pleases me. When you arrive at my residence we will gather ingredients and make a meal,” became human-sounding: “Yay! When you get here we’ll cook dinner.” Although nothing takes the place of practicing in person via daily necessity, language-learning resources available online were also indispensable.

We eventually became engaged, which transpired through hilariously translated conversations meant to be serious. Technical versions of our declarations of love were mutually understood. Our wildly different cultural and language backgrounds merged to reveal that we’re compatible with the universal art of Netflix binges. I’d also finally managed to find the movie soulmate I’d longed for who would sweep me off my feet with cheesy horror films. Not all partners are cinematically compatible. Since we’ve not yet conquered movie theater outings with our mishmashed language skills, Netflix lovingly provides us with the choice of subtitles and sometimes dubbed versions. We playfully argue over who will read a movie, but this feature facilitates our ability to enjoy routines together. Discovering Arabic language series and movies — including Egyptian melodramas that manage to incorporate musical numbers into movies about mobsters — has undoubtedly improved my cinema experience.

We are both interested in politics and world policy as it relates to our respective countries. Social media is a valuable tool for learning about what’s happening on the ground in Mostafa’s city of Aleppo, Syria. I’ve gotten a much better understanding of complexities in the Middle East because of his patient explanations. I’ve never had occasion to date someone from a conflict zone and I would tend to forget what was going on in Syria because it isn’t my home and because our daily lives continue uninterrupted and peaceful. Learning about what’s going on in Syria through social media is often difficult and heart-wrenching, but I don’t look away. I’ve gotten involved with supporting causes for refugees through social media by locating organizations both online and in Germany. This has impacted my relationship with Mostafa in ways I didn’t anticipate, including his overwhelming love for my do-gooding.

Once we conquered each other and became engaged, it was time for Mostafa and me to meet each other’s families. My mother traveled to Germany where she met Mostafa for the first time when we went out to dinner. By this point, my German was strong enough to translate between Mostafa and my mother. Meeting his family was a bit more challenging because our relationship transpired on our own terms, not conventional cultural norms. Despite this fact, I was welcomed into his family with open arms. Conversations between myself and Mostafa’s family are largely through texting because we still need translation apps.

Technology has offered all of us an opportunity to enhance our experiences. For my relationship, it made loving someone possible. Without it, I would not have found Mostafa or pursued a relationship that was against the odds from the start. Searching for connections is human nature and something that can’t be outsourced to technology. Relationships continue to thrive in the digital era. Though technology helped us progress together quickly, but we love completely on our own.
