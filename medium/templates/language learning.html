                                MY FIANCE FOUND ME THROUGH A HASHTAG ON INSTAGRAM — BUT THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING
Technology has revolutionized humanity right down to the most primitive task of finding a mate. Withapps like Tinder [https://onezero.medium.com/teaching-a-robot-to-like-27c5e8bf6f0], happily ever after is possibly just a swipe and an awkward meeting away.

But what happens when couples find themselves in unconventional predicaments? Such was my case when I began exchanging messages with Mostafa on Instagram. We found each other through my very amateur nature picture I had hashtagged #Germany, so our initial messages were in German. His native language is Arabic and mine is English. We didn’t have a shared fluent language, so after a month of discombobulated Google Translate exchanges, we met for coffee and awkwardness. In true American fashion, my bilingual skills only extended to ordering food despite making my home in Germany. Since Mostafa was already fluent in German, it became our middle ground.

There are also vast cultural differences that required research for me to better understand Mostafa. From traditions to religion, so much about him was a mystery to me. Having crossed paths in a country foreign to both of us, we were on neutral ground when it came to what “normal” was to each of us. Our journey together began and progressed because of technology.

Having always taken for granted my luxury of free movement in the world, my perspective was dramatically altered by the reality that Mostafa and I don’t have the ability to visit each other’s home countries. He’s from Syria, which effectively renders him blacklisted from entering the United States. For obvious reasons, we are also unable to visit Syria together. While we wait for technology to fix wars and terrible policy by fostering communication and civilized advancement in leadership, Google Earth offers an aerial view for us to reminisce with each other and conduct virtual tours together. I won’t be able to introduce him to the exciting world of Walmart superstores just yet, but harnessing satellite technology makes for a fulfilling Saturday date night.

Progressing together on the linguistic front included many hours spent frantically typing into translator apps to keep the serious conversation flowing. My German improved through everyday interaction with Mostafa. He also leveled up in English via our hybrid German/English discussions. Somewhere in the mix, he began teaching me basic Arabic.

Enter the magic of YouTube and the bevy of language courses available for absolutely free. These resources allowed for our comically formal sweet-nothing texts to take a more conversational tone. Gone were the days he reminded me by text, “Hello darling, he is now putting clothing on his body and will lovingly operate a motor vehicle to your location,” to let me know he was driving to me. My response of, “This pleases me. When you arrive at my residence we will gather ingredients and make a meal,” became human-sounding: “Yay! When you get here we’ll cook dinner.” Although nothing takes the place of practicing in person via daily necessity, language-learning resources available online were also indispensable.

We eventually became engaged, which transpired through hilariously translated conversations meant to be serious. Technical versions of our declarations of love were mutually understood. Our wildly different cultural and language backgrounds merged to reveal that we’re compatible with the universal art of Netflix binges. I’d also finally managed to find the movie soulmate I’d longed for who would sweep me off my feet with cheesy horror films. Not all partners are cinematically compatible. Since we’ve not yet conquered movie theater outings with our mishmashed language skills, Netflix lovingly provides us with the choice of subtitles and sometimes dubbed versions. We playfully argue over who will read a movie, but this feature facilitates our ability to enjoy routines together. Discovering Arabic language series and movies — including Egyptian melodramas that manage to incorporate musical numbers into movies about mobsters — has undoubtedly improved my cinema experience.

We are both interested in politics and world policy as it relates to our respective countries. Social media is a valuable tool for learning about what’s happening on the ground in Mostafa’s city of Aleppo, Syria. I’ve gotten a much better understanding of complexities in the Middle East because of his patient explanations. I’ve never had occasion to date someone from a conflict zone and I would tend to forget what was going on in Syria because it isn’t my home and because our daily lives continue uninterrupted and peaceful. Learning about what’s going on in Syria through social media is often difficult and heart-wrenching, but I don’t look away. I’ve gotten involved with supporting causes for refugees through social media by locating organizations both online and in Germany. This has impacted my relationship with Mostafa in ways I didn’t anticipate, including his overwhelming love for my do-gooding.

Once we conquered each other and became engaged, it was time for Mostafa and me to meet each other’s families. My mother traveled to Germany where she met Mostafa for the first time when we went out to dinner. By this point, my German was strong enough to translate between Mostafa and my mother. Meeting his family was a bit more challenging because our relationship transpired on our own terms, not conventional cultural norms. Despite this fact, I was welcomed into his family with open arms. Conversations between myself and Mostafa’s family are largely through texting because we still need translation apps.

Technology has offered all of us an opportunity to enhance our experiences. For my relationship, it made loving someone possible. Without it, I would not have found Mostafa or pursued a relationship that was against the odds from the start. Searching for connections is human nature and something that can’t be outsourced to technology. Relationships continue to thrive in the digital era. Though technology helped us progress together quickly, but we love completely on our own.
