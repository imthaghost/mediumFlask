												Delegate Work So It Actually Gets Done</a>
										</h3>
										<div class="entry-excerpt">
											<p class="entry-tit">
												Like many founders, when I started my first business, I was new to
												managing people. I loved getting stuff done and getting my hands dirty,
												so the idea of delegating work to others was unnatural. I’d always
												rather do it myself.

												When I did have to delegate, it often left me feeling frustrated. I’d
												find out later that the work hadn’t turned out as I’d expected, or it
												wasn’t even close to completion. I took it personally, and it weighed on
												my mind. I felt that if I wanted something done right, I had to do it
												myself. And as my workload increased, I rapidly approached burnout.

												THE PROBLEM WITH MY APPROACH
												A few years ago, I realized I had been delegating all wrong. At the
												time, I had been in the process of hiring a senior marketer and had
												asked our office manager to research recruiting agencies, get in touch
												with each of them, and report back to me.

												A couple of days later, the office manager gave me an update: He’d
												emailed several agencies, but most of them hadn’t responded. My heart
												sank. This didn’t help me one bit.

												“Did you follow up with a phone call?” I asked.

												“Sorry,” he replied. “I’ve only got limited time available. I just have
												too many other priorities.”

												Later, I reflected on this situation with a mentor. The manager had done
												what I’d told him to do. Yet, here I was, frustrated and knowing that
												somehow the way I delegated wasn’t working out for me. My mentor then
												gave me some wise advice that has totally changed the way I assign
												projects.

												DELEGATE PROBLEMS, NOT TASKS
												When you’re in execution mode, you naturally think in terms of critical
												tasks, but good delegation requires you to think in terms of outcomes. I
												realized that theproblemof filling my calendar with qualified candidates
												hadn’t been explicitly delegated — just the task of contacting
												recruiters. But if that specific problem had been assigned to be solved,
												I could’ve been on my way to interviewing and hiring the right person
												for the job.

												The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being
												micromanaged.

												Once you identify the core problem to delegate, check that it actually
												solves your problem. For example, interviewing candidates throughout the
												following week would have given me a scheduling problem. What I really
												wanted was to set aside a single morning for interviews.

												COACH, DON’T INSTRUCT
												Delegating problems is only the first step. The next part is even more
												important: to help the person you’re delegating to findtheirsolution.
												The job of a coach is to help others work through their problems and
												find their own solutions. When I started coaching founders, I learned
												some great people-management techniques that I wish I’d known earlier in
												my career.

												The simplest and most relevant one is the GROW framework, created by Sir
												John Whitmore. Here’s how to use the GROW model when delegating
												problems:

												1. GOAL: ESTABLISH THE GOAL
												Once you’ve delegated the problem, ask your employee to explain what a
												good result would look and feel like. Answer any questions they ask to
												help them understand what outcomes would resolve the problem. Once the
												goal is clear, make sure they write it down.

												2. REALITY: EXAMINE THE CURRENT REALITY
												Before jumping into solutions, allow your employee to get a handle on
												the situation. Use the following questions:

												* Where are we now in relation to the goal?
												* What’s working and what isn’t working?
												* Is anything stopping you from making progress?

												3. OPTIONS: EXPLORE THE OPTIONS
												Next, you want to help your employee examine different options that
												could address the problem. Pose questions like:

												* What are your options?
												* What else could you do?
												* Who do you know who has encountered a similar situation?

												As with any brainstorm, don’t shoot down any options just yet.

												4. WILL: ESTABLISH THE WILL
												Finally, get a commitment from the employee and help them map out their
												next steps. Again, let them come up with solutions by asking questions:

												* What do you think you need to do right now?
												* How will you know when you have done it?
												* What resources can help you?

												Scaling your business requires effective delegation. As you grow your
												company, the need to adopt a coaching relationship with your direct
												reports intensifies. The best workers tend to love to solve problems —
												and they hate being micromanaged. This is especially true ifyou’re
												hiring people who are better than you

												Effective delegation is also great for keeping your employees motivated.
												Solving problems helps people connect with their purpose, learn new
												things, and stay in control of their own destiny.

										Work So It Actually Gets Done</a>
								</h2>
								<div class="entry-excerpt">
									<p class="entry-tit">
										Like many founders, when I started my first business, I was new to managing
										people. I loved getting stuff done and getting my hands dirty, so the idea of
										delegating work to others was unnatural. I’d always rather do it myself.

										When I did have to delegate, it often left me feeling frustrated. I’d find out
										later that the work hadn’t turned out as I’d expected, or it wasn’t even close
										to completion. I took it personally, and it weighed on my mind. I felt that if I
										wanted something done right, I had to do it myself. And as my workload
										increased, I rapidly approached burnout.

										THE PROBLEM WITH MY APPROACH
										A few years ago, I realized I had been delegating all wrong. At the time, I had
										been in the process of hiring a senior marketer and had asked our office manager
										to research recruiting agencies, get in touch with each of them, and report back
										to me.

										A couple of days later, the office manager gave me an update: He’d emailed
										several agencies, but most of them hadn’t responded. My heart sank. This didn’t
										help me one bit.

										“Did you follow up with a phone call?” I asked.

										“Sorry,” he replied. “I’ve only got limited time available. I just have too many
										other priorities.”

										Later, I reflected on this situation with a mentor. The manager had done what
										I’d told him to do. Yet, here I was, frustrated and knowing that somehow the way
										I delegated wasn’t working out for me. My mentor then gave me some wise advice
										that has totally changed the way I assign projects.

										DELEGATE PROBLEMS, NOT TASKS
										When you’re in execution mode, you naturally think in terms of critical tasks,
										but good delegation requires you to think in terms of outcomes. I realized that
										theproblemof filling my calendar with qualified candidates hadn’t been
										explicitly delegated — just the task of contacting recruiters. But if that
										specific problem had been assigned to be solved, I could’ve been on my way to
										interviewing and hiring the right person for the job.

										The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being
										micromanaged.

										Once you identify the core problem to delegate, check that it actually solves
										your problem. For example, interviewing candidates throughout the following week
										would have given me a scheduling problem. What I really wanted was to set aside
										a single morning for interviews.

										COACH, DON’T INSTRUCT
										Delegating problems is only the first step. The next part is even more
										important: to help the person you’re delegating to findtheirsolution. The job of
										a coach is to help others work through their problems and find their own
										solutions. When I started coaching founders, I learned some great
										people-management techniques that I wish I’d known earlier in my career.

										The simplest and most relevant one is the GROW framework, created by Sir John
										Whitmore. Here’s how to use the GROW model when delegating problems:

										1. GOAL: ESTABLISH THE GOAL
										Once you’ve delegated the problem, ask your employee to explain what a good
										result would look and feel like. Answer any questions they ask to help them
										understand what outcomes would resolve the problem. Once the goal is clear, make
										sure they write it down.

										2. REALITY: EXAMINE THE CURRENT REALITY
										Before jumping into solutions, allow your employee to get a handle on the
										situation. Use the following questions:

										* Where are we now in relation to the goal?
										* What’s working and what isn’t working?
										* Is anything stopping you from making progress?

										3. OPTIONS: EXPLORE THE OPTIONS
										Next, you want to help your employee examine different options that could
										address the problem. Pose questions like:

										* What are your options?
										* What else could you do?
										* Who do you know who has encountered a similar situation?

										As with any brainstorm, don’t shoot down any options just yet.

										4. WILL: ESTABLISH THE WILL
										Finally, get a commitment from the employee and help them map out their next
										steps. Again, let them come up with solutions by asking questions:

										* What do you think you need to do right now?
										* How will you know when you have done it?
										* What resources can help you?

										Scaling your business requires effective delegation. As you grow your company,
										the need to adopt a coaching relationship with your direct reports intensifies.
										The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being
										micromanaged. This is especially true ifyou’re hiring people who are better than
										you
										[https://medium.dave-bailey.com/what-stops-startups-hiring-a-players-785cfbf6040f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=4c8f2636f5284d7b34699d3fd41bbc95].

										Effective delegation is also great for keeping your employees motivated. Solving
										problems helps people connect with their purpose, learn new things, and stay in
										control of their own destiny.

												<p class="over entry-tit">
													It’s not humanly possible to read every piece of productivity advice
													that exists, but I think I’ve come close. And at one point or
													another, I’ve tried most of that advice for myself, no matter how
													unpleasant or out-there it seemed. There was a time when I took cold
													showers because I heard it would help me combat procrastination. (It
													did not.)

													Eventually, there came a moment when I realized that studying all
													these time-management hacks and calendar systems and multistep
													strategies was only stalling me from the real work of actually
													getting things done. I already knew the most powerful productivity
													technique. It was just a matter of using it.

													There are only two steps:

													1. Physically get in your work position.
													2. Do one small thing.

													That’s it. That’s the whole thing.

													It’s simple, but it isn’t easy. Oftentimes, we do everything in our
													power to avoid that first step. We grab another cup of coffee, go
													for a walk, read a book, run errands. Before I wrote this piece, I
													meticulously rearranged my bookshelf. I tried to escape. The voice
													inside my head told me to turn on Netflix.

													But instead, I sat down at my desk. I put my phone away and closed
													my internet browser. And I started working on theone small thing
													[https://dariusforoux.com/one-thing/]that I scheduled for the day.
													Then, like magic, I was working.

													The real secret of this technique is that you must do it again
													tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. Build up
													momentum and keep it. Author Will Durant may have said it best when
													he wrote, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an
													act, but a habit.”

													It’s theNon-Zero Day principle
													[https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/]: Just do one thing every day
													that will help you move toward your goal. As Reddit user ryans01
													wrote ina post
													[https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/]that
													inspired the movement, “Didn’t do anything all fucking day and it’s
													11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One push up. Read one page of that
													chapter. One. Because one is non zero.”

													We can talk about the newest productivity systems all day, but doing
													so won’t get the real work done. At some point, you have to sit in
													your chair and just get started.

													INTRODUCTION
													Node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/] is a JavaScript runtime environment
													that allows one to run JS on the server. It is built on the
													open-source V8 JavaScript engine [https://developers.google.com/v8/]
													used in Chrome and written in C++ which executes JS in a standalone
													environment.

													AWS [https://aws.amazon.com/] (Amazon Web Services), a subsidiary of
													Amazon, is a cloud computing platform which provides resources for
													computation such as EC2 instances, various database and storage
													facilities as well as networking and content delivery options.

													Nginx [https://www.nginx.com] is a free and open-source HTTP server
													which doubles up as a reverse proxy server or as a mail proxy
													server. It is a high performance server with simple configuration
													options and low resource consumption.

													EC2 [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/] (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web
													service which provides computing power in the form of scalable
													server instances. Multiple EC2 instances are run on the same machine
													inside Amazon’s computing infrastructure. When an EC2 instance is
													initiated, a set amount of resources (OS, RAM, Disk Space etc.,
													chosen at the time of initiation) are allotted to the user from the
													machine it runs on. This allows sharing of resources between
													multiple users.

													Linux AMI [https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/] is a copy of
													Linux (image) provided by AWS which can be used for free on an EC2
													instance as an OS. It can contain pre-installed packages such as
													Python, MySQL, Node.js etc., depending on the chosen AMI.

													THINGS TO DO
													1. Create an AWS account
													2. Launch an EC2 instance
													3. SSH into your instance
													4. Install Node.js
													5. Install Git and clone repository from GitHub
													6. Start the node.js app
													7. Keep the app running
													8. Move the app to port 80 (not really)
													9. Configure Nginx to autostart on instance reboot

													CREATE AN AWS ACCOUNT
													Go to AWS [https://aws.amazon.com], click on Create an AWS account.
													If you are already registered, sign in, else create a new account. A
													new account lets you try the free tier for 12 months. Choose
													Personal Account unless you have a business setup for which you will
													need the company details.

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*y6Qmrx8juIZS2BFmiVWw_Q.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/993/1*y6Qmrx8juIZS2BFmiVWw_Q.png]Create
													a personal AWS accountYou will have to enter your card details for a
													small refundable charge to verify your identity. Once the
													registration is confirmed, you can go to the console.

													Service Dashboard (after registration)LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE
													Now that the account is setup, you are ready to launch an EC2

													Depending on the OS you are using on your PC, there are different
													methods to SSH into your instance. You can see the applicable method
													by clicking on Connect in the above screen. Since I use Windows OS,
													I use a third party SSH client called PuTTY to connect to the
													instance. You can follow the official tutorial
													[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html] on
													AWS docs for using PuTTY as the SSH client.

													established the connection you will see a terminal similar to this.

													connection established with the EC2 instancePUTTY FREQUENT
													DISCONNECTION / TIMEOUT
													If you use PuTTY, you will see that the terminal frequently becomes
													non-responsive because of a session timeout. You can change the
													session settings to keep the connection alive by going to the
													category Connection of the loaded session and change the value of
													Seconds between keepalives to 30. This will enable sending empty
													packets to the remote server via SSH every 30 seconds to keep the
													session alive.

													INSTALL NODE.JS
													Now that we are connected to the instance, we can start installing
													the required packages in the environment for your node.js app to
													work. We will be using NVM [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](Node
													Version Manager) to install node.js as it provides a neat way to
													manage multiple node.js versions on the instance if required. Run
													the following code in the terminal to get NVM and install it.

													curl -o-
													https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh
													| bash

													The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source
													line to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or
													~/.bashrc). Now, run nvm --version. The terminal will show command
													not found as the code has been added to your profile but hasn’t run
													yet. It runs on every login, so login again by creating a new
													session. Run nvm --version again and this time you should be able to
													see the installed version of NVM.

													installationTo install node, you can either use nvm install node to
													install the latest version of node or use nvm install
													&lt;node_version&gt; to install a specific version of node. Once
													node is installed, you can check the installed version with node
													--version.

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*__x_ULKOa2pQMOFk6DvGqg.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/659/1*__x_ULKOa2pQMOFk6DvGqg.png]Node.js
													installationINSTALL GIT AND CLONE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB
													We will install Git to clone your node.js repository from your
													GitHub account. To install Git, run the following command.

													sudo yum install git

													This will install the latest version of Git on the instance. Once
													installation is done, you are ready to clone your repository. Run
													the following command to clone your repository. Replace
													&lt;username&gt;with your GitHub username,
													&lt;repository-name&gt;with the name of your node.js app repository
													and &lt;folder-name&gt;with the name of the folder you want to clone
													the repository into. This folder will be created under
													/home/ec2-user/.

													git clone
													https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository-name&gt;.git
													&lt;folder-name&gt;

													Run cd &lt;folder-name&gt; to move inside this folder and ls to see
													its contents.

													START THE NODE.JS APP
													If your start script does not include npm install you should run it
													manually first, otherwise you can directly issue the command to
													start the app which should install the dependencies automatically.
													There are several ways to start the app depending on how you have
													set it up. Choose one which suits you.

													node server.js
													node app.js
													node ./bin/www
													npm start

													The app will now run at the port number that you have specified in
													the start script. It could be 3000, 8000, 8080 etc. Make a note of
													this port number and enter the public DNS of the instance with the
													port number in the browser to see the app output. I use port 3000,
													you can replace it with yours.

													http://ec2-54-191-104-59.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

													As you will see, this will not work and there would be nothing to
													show on the page and the browser connection will timeout. This is
													because we haven’t opened port 3000 for access to public. This is
													where the Security Group comes in. In the AWS management console, go
													to Security Groups, select the one not named ‘default’
													(launch-wizard-1 or similar) and edit the Inbound rules.

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*07PnlnkoK-24Yb2gbasLyw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1363/1*07PnlnkoK-24Yb2gbasLyw.png]Security

													rules for the EC2 instanceAccess the URL again and you should be
													able to see the app content now.

													KEEP THE APP RUNNING
													The app will run as long as you have the terminal open and you have
													not stopped it manually. But as soon as you close the terminal or
													press Ctrl-C or its equivalent, the app will stop as its process is
													not running in the background, it’s tied to the active terminal. You
													can write a script to run the process in the background but you will
													also have to take care of restarting the process in the background
													in case it crashes or if you perform a pull from the repository or
													if you update the app in some other way. But there’s an easier way
													to do all this by using a process manager for node called PM2
													[http://pm2.keymetrics.io/]. We will focus on the auto-restart and
													background process functionalities of PM2 here. More functionalities
													in a later article on continuous integration.

													Kill all the running node processes (if any) — killall -9 node.
													Install PM2 globally with the following command:

													npm install pm2 -g

													Move to the cloned folder and execute one of the following commands
													depending on how you had started the app before:

													pm2 start server.js
													pm2 start app.js
													pm2 start ./bin/www
													pm2 start npm --name
													&#34;&lt;name_the_process_anything_you_want&gt;&#34; -- start

													Now even if you close the terminal and check the url in the browser,
													the app will be running. Sweet! For automatically running PM2 when
													the server restarts, issue the following command:

													pm2 startup

													This will output a script in the terminal which you need to run,
													copy the script that it outputs and run it in the terminal window.
													Now, save all the currently running processes so that they can be
													run again whenever PM2 restarts either manually or by a script with
													the following command:

													pm2 save

													Now you can try rebooting the instance and visit the url and see if
													the app works or not. To see a list of the currently active node
													processes with their process names, run pm2 list and to monitor any
													one of the processes run pm2 monit.

													MOVE THE APP TO PORT 80 (NOT REALLY)
													The URL for our app contains the port number 3000 which if you have
													surfed the web a lot will appear a bit out of the place because you
													don’t usually see such numbers in the URLs, reason being the
													websites are generally served on the standard port 80 used for HTTP
													requests and browsers assume it by default.

													Currently our node server is running on a publicly open port which
													is not a particularly brilliant idea as we are directly exposing the
													application server to internet traffic and also reducing performance
													by not taking advantages
													[https://www.nginx.com/blog/5-performance-tips-for-node-js-applications/]
													of load balancing or serving static content efficiently.

													A better way to manage this is to use Nginx as a reverse proxy
													server in front of all other application servers. It will act as an
													efficient web server routing multiple requests on port 80 to
													different application servers based on the requested domain or even
													route high volume internet traffic to the same domain on port 80 to
													multiple instances of the application server listening on different
													private ports to perform load balancing in case of application
													server overloading or crashing. Nginx also takes care of SSL
													encryption
													[https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/]
													instead of letting Node do all the work.

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NFejJ5lJR3nyRLqGicdGbw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/742/1*NFejJ5lJR3nyRLqGicdGbw.png]Setting
													up Nginx in front of the application servers. Image courtesy - Floyd
													Smith
													[https://www.nginx.com/blog/5-performance-tips-for-node-js-applications/]Let’s
													install Nginx first:

													sudo yum install nginx

													and verify the installed version with nginx -v.

													Open port 80 by adding another inbound rule to the security group.

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vEiEHoHc8Wpihh7DBDiffw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1003/1*vEiEHoHc8Wpihh7DBDiffw.png]Open
													port 80 for public accessEnter the public DNS or the public IP of
													your EC2 instance in the browser now without a port and you should
													see the default Nginx welcome page.

													http://ec2-54-191-104-59.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

													[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RbcJHpPp3yYQwjZWRTrYRQ.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1297/1*RbcJHpPp3yYQwjZWRTrYRQ.png]The
													default Nginx welcome pageNow, we are not really going to move the
													app to listen on port 80, the app will still be running on port
													3000. We will install Nginx in front of the application server, run
													it on port 80 so that it can intercept all internet traffic and
													route it to port 3000 where the required application server will be
													listening if the HTTP headers match (more details in the next
													article on serving the site on HTTPS). A nice explanation of why we
													should be doing this is available here
													[https://stackoverflow.com/a/16770780].

													To use port 80 to route requests to the application server on port
													3000, we will edit the nginx configuration file — nginx.conf as
													follows.

													Open the nginx.conf file with an editor in the terminal:

													sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

													If there’s no server block listening on port 80, add one or change
													it if it already exists to look like this:

													server {
													listen 80 default_server;
													listen [::]:80 default_server;
													server_name localhost;
													root /usr/share/nginx/html; location / {
													proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
													proxy_http_version 1.1;
													proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
													proxy_set_header Connection &#39;upgrade&#39;;
													proxy_set_header Host $host;
													proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
													}
													}

													Since we have a single server block listening on port 80, all
													traffic will be routed from here itself regardless of the value of
													the server_name directive. The location directive has been changed
													to point to the resource from where the content has to be served, in
													our case it is the node.js application server running on the private
													localhost IP 127.0.0.1 and port 3000. Ignore the other directives
													for now.

													Save the configuration and restart the server with the following
													command:

													sudo service nginx restart

													You will now have all HTTP traffic available on port 80 forwarded to
													port 3000. You should close port 3000 to public access by removing
													it from the security group settings. Visit the URL again in the
													browser without the port and you will be able to see the app content
													now instead of the default Nginx welcome page.

													CONFIGURE NGINX TO AUTOSTART ON INSTANCE REBOOT
													There’s just one last thing to take care of before we wrap up. We
													need to configure Nginx to start automatically if the instance is
													rebooted. Execute the following command to do this:

													sudo chkconfig nginx on

													You can close the session, reboot the instance and visit the URL
													again. You should see the app being served on port 80.

													And now we are done! Pheww!!




													Since, we have the app being served on port 80 now, we will take
													care of the following stuff in the next article:

													1. Buy and register a domain name
													2. Serve the website on the registered domain
													3. Obtain an SSL certificate for the registered domain
													4. Install the SSL certificate on the server
													5. Run SSL test for the website
													6. Update security parameters on the website
													7. Automatically renew the certificate

													If you are stuck at any point in the sections above or if I have
													made a mistake somewhere or missed an essential point, do let me
													know in the comments.

													node app instead of using PHP application on GoDaddy?

													# First thing to do:

													wget -qO- https://cdn.rawgit.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh |
													bash

													# Second validate your source file

													source $HOME/.nvm/nvm.shnvm install stable

													# Now check the version of your node and npm

													nvm ls

													You would see something like this:

													Then, go to public_html folder and create htaccess file and

													cd ~/public_htmlnano .htaccess

													# Copy information below, (3000) is the default port for express,
													change whatever port that you are going to setu

													RewriteEngine On

													-rw-r--r-- 1 abcdef abcdef 4282 Jul 3 2014 layout-styles.css

													Once your finish your installation, go to express site to copy some
													of the startup code

													Express &#34;Hello World&#34; exampleThe example above is actually a
													working server: Go ahead and click on the URL shown. You&#39;ll get
													a response, with…expressjs.commkdir myapp
													cd myapp
													npm init -y
													npm install express --save
													touch index.js

													Don’t forget to copy this code to your index.js file:

													const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)
													const app = express()
													const port = 3000app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt;
													res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;))app.listen(port, () =&gt;
													console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))

													Now you are almost compete everything.

													All you need is to make the server run all the time and no matter it
													crash or update

													# install the forever start package on your server

													npm i pm2 -g

													# since the pm2 is very handy tool, you just run this command to run
													the server and restart by adding — watch tag

												Delegate Work So It Actually Gets Done
											</a>
										</h3>
										<div class="entry-excerpt">
											<p class="entry-tit">
												Like many founders, when I started my first business, I was new to
												managing people. I loved getting stuff done and getting my hands dirty,
												so the idea of delegating work to others was unnatural. I’d always
												rather do it myself.

												When I did have to delegate, it often left me feeling frustrated. I’d
												find out later that the work hadn’t turned out as I’d expected, or it
												wasn’t even close to completion. I took it personally, and it weighed on
												my mind. I felt that if I wanted something done right, I had to do it
												myself. And as my workload increased, I rapidly approached burnout.

												THE PROBLEM WITH MY APPROACH
												A few years ago, I realized I had been delegating all wrong. At the
												time, I had been in the process of hiring a senior marketer and had
												asked our office manager to research recruiting agencies, get in touch
												with each of them, and report back to me.

												A couple of days later, the office manager gave me an update: He’d
												emailed several agencies, but most of them hadn’t responded. My heart
												sank. This didn’t help me one bit.

												“Did you follow up with a phone call?” I asked.

												“Sorry,” he replied. “I’ve only got limited time available. I just have
												too many other priorities.”

												Later, I reflected on this situation with a mentor. The manager had done
												what I’d told him to do. Yet, here I was, frustrated and knowing that
												somehow the way I delegated wasn’t working out for me. My mentor then
												gave me some wise advice that has totally changed the way I assign
												projects.

												DELEGATE PROBLEMS, NOT TASKS
												When you’re in execution mode, you naturally think in terms of critical
												tasks, but good delegation requires you to think in terms of outcomes. I
												realized that theproblemof filling my calendar with qualified candidates
												hadn’t been explicitly delegated — just the task of contacting
												recruiters. But if that specific problem had been assigned to be solved,
												I could’ve been on my way to interviewing and hiring the right person
												for the job.

												The best workers tend to love to solve problems — and they hate being
												micromanaged.

												Once you identify the core problem to delegate, check that it actually
												solves your problem. For example, interviewing candidates throughout the
												following week would have given me a scheduling problem. What I really
												wanted was to set aside a single morning for interviews.

												COACH, DON’T INSTRUCT
												Delegating problems is only the first step. The next part is even more
												important: to help the person you’re delegating to findtheirsolution.
												The job of a coach is to help others work through their problems and
												find their own solutions. When I started coaching founders, I learned
												some great people-management techniques that I wish I’d known earlier in
												my career.

												The simplest and most relevant one is the GROW framework, created by Sir
												John Whitmore. Here’s how to use the GROW model when delegating
												problems:

												1. GOAL: ESTABLISH THE GOAL
												Once you’ve delegated the problem, ask your employee to explain what a
												good result would look and feel like. Answer any questions they ask to
												help them understand what outcomes would resolve the problem. Once the
												goal is clear, make sure they write it down.

												2. REALITY: EXAMINE THE CURRENT REALITY
												Before jumping into solutions, allow your employee to get a handle on
												the situation. Use the following questions:

												* Where are we now in relation to the goal?
												* What’s working and what isn’t working?
												* Is anything stopping you from making progress?

												3. OPTIONS: EXPLORE THE OPTIONS
												Next, you want to help your employee examine different options that
												could address the problem. Pose questions like:

												* What are your options?
												* What else could you do?
												* Who do you know who has encountered a similar situation?

												As with any brainstorm, don’t shoot down any options just yet.

												4. WILL: ESTABLISH THE WILL
												Finally, get a commitment from the employee and help them map out their
												next steps. Again, let them come up with solutions by asking questions:

												* What do you think you need to do right now?
												* How will you know when you have done it?
												* What resources can help you?

												Scaling your business requires effective delegation. As you grow your
												company, the need to adopt a coaching relationship with your direct
												reports intensifies. The best workers tend to love to solve problems —
												and they hate being micromanaged. This is especially true ifyou’re
												hiring people who are better than you

												Effective delegation is also great for keeping your employees motivated.
												Solving problems helps people connect with their purpose, learn new
												things, and stay in control of their own destiny.

										</h3>
										<div class="entry-excerpt">
											<p class="entry-tit">
												A hot topic in recent years is whether PHP is losing its leading
												position or even going to its end. After all, many internet companies
												are trying out other languages. Some languages draw our attention
												greatly. Golang is well known for the coroutine. Java is best for the
												perfect ecological system. And Python is skilled in computing and
												artificial intelligence. But surely, PHP won’t go to its grave.

												We will analyze it in the following sections:

												* The Development of PHP
												* PHP Frameworks
												* Packagist

												THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHP
												PHP is always heading forward. Many excellent programmers devote
												themselves to PHP’s development. As a result, a new version of PHP is
												released almost every year. The version of 7.3 was released in 2018, and
												the 7.4 will come out at the end of 2019.

												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/php1-07e2.jpeg]

												The development of PHP is amazing. 7.0 reconstructs the kernel of PHP.
												And the performance of PHP is boosted by two to three times as the new
												zend engine is added.

												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/php2-1e2c.jpeg]

												PHP FRAMEWORKS
												Whether a language is strong enough or not is closely related to its
												framework. There are frameworks, such as Laravel and Yii, which have
												been developers’ favorites for many years and projects. Meanwhile,
												Swoft, though a new framework, attracts our attention and motives us to
												study it.

												LARAVEL
												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/laravel-2bc0.jpeg]

												Laravel [https://github.com/laravel/laravel]is a PHP-based web framework
												for building high-end web applications using its significant and
												graceful syntaxes. It comes with a strong collection of tools and
												provides application architecture. Moreover, it includes various
												characteristics of technologies like ASP.NET MVC, CodeIgniter, Ruby on
												Rails, and many more. This is an open source framework.

												It facilitates developers by saving time and helps reduce thinking and
												planning when developing an entire website from scratch. Along with
												that, Laravel also assists in introducing basic security to your
												application.

												Hence, all its features can boost your web development pace. If anyone
												is familiar with the basics of PHP along with some intermediate PHP
												scripting, then Laravel can craft your work more easily.

												Resources for learning:

												* Laravel 5.4 from Scratch (Laracasts)
												* Build a task list with Laravel and Vue

												YII
												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/yii-9326.jpeg]

												Yii [https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2]is a generic Web programming
												framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds of Web
												applications using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and
												sophisticated caching support, it is especially suitable for developing
												large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content management
												systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web services, and so on.

												SWOFT
												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/swoft-a125.jpeg]

												Swoft [https://github.com/swoft-cloud/swoft]is a PHP high-performance
												microservice coroutine framework. It has been published for many years
												and has become the best choice for PHP. It can be like Go, a built-in
												coroutine web server and common coroutine client, and is resident in
												memory, independent of traditional PHP-FPM. There are similar Go
												language operations, similar to the Spring Cloud framework flexible
												annotations.

												PACKAGIST
												One way to find out whether the industry still likes PHP is looking into
												its ecological system: the packagist. As the below figure shows, the
												number of packagists for PHP has mushroomed with an index growth
												pattern. By now, the number of packagists has reached 223,217, and the
												total install number is around 14,827,204,847. The ecological system of
												PHP is reconstructing faster and faster.

												[https://nodepress.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/php3-0e4b.jpeg]

												CONCLUSION
												PHP won’t step into its grave. You should take a look at it, and think
												about it carefully.

												Most Underrated Productivity Technique Is Also the Simplest
											</a>
										</h3>
										<div class="entry-excerpt">
											<p class="entry-tit">
												It’s not humanly possible to read every piece of productivity advice
												that exists, but I think I’ve come close. And at one point or another,
												I’ve tried most of that advice for myself, no matter how unpleasant or
												out-there it seemed. There was a time when I took cold showers because I
												heard it would help me combat procrastination. (It did not.)

												Eventually, there came a moment when I realized that studying all these
												time-management hacks and calendar systems and multistep strategies was
												only stalling me from the real work of actually getting things done. I
												already knew the most powerful productivity technique. It was just a
												matter of using it.

												There are only two steps:

												1. Physically get in your work position.
												2. Do one small thing.

												That’s it. That’s the whole thing.

												It’s simple, but it isn’t easy. Oftentimes, we do everything in our
												power to avoid that first step. We grab another cup of coffee, go for a
												walk, read a book, run errands. Before I wrote this piece, I
												meticulously rearranged my bookshelf. I tried to escape. The voice
												inside my head told me to turn on Netflix.

												But instead, I sat down at my desk. I put my phone away and closed my
												internet browser. And I started working on theone small thing
												[https://dariusforoux.com/one-thing/]that I scheduled for the day. Then,
												like magic, I was working.

												The real secret of this technique is that you must do it again tomorrow,
												and the next day, and the day after that. Build up momentum and keep it.
												Author Will Durant may have said it best when he wrote, “We are what we
												repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

												It’s theNon-Zero Day principle [https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/]:
												Just do one thing every day that will help you move toward your goal. As
												Reddit user ryans01 wrote ina post
												[https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/]that
												inspired the movement, “Didn’t do anything all fucking day and it’s
												11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One push up. Read one page of that
												chapter. One. Because one is non zero.”

												We can talk about the newest productivity systems all day, but doing so
												won’t get the real work done. At some point, you have to sit in your
												chair and just get started.

												MY FIANCE FOUND ME THROUGH A HASHTAG ON INSTAGRAM — BUT THAT WAS ONLY
												THE BEGINNING
												Technology has revolutionized humanity right down to the most primitive
												task of finding a mate. Withapps like Tinder
												[https://onezero.medium.com/teaching-a-robot-to-like-27c5e8bf6f0],
												happily ever after is possibly just a swipe and an awkward meeting away.

												But what happens when couples find themselves in unconventional
												predicaments? Such was my case when I began exchanging messages with
												Mostafa on Instagram. We found each other through my very amateur nature
												picture I had hashtagged #Germany, so our initial messages were in
												German. His native language is Arabic and mine is English. We didn’t
												have a shared fluent language, so after a month of discombobulated
												Google Translate exchanges, we met for coffee and awkwardness. In true
												American fashion, my bilingual skills only extended to ordering food
												despite making my home in Germany. Since Mostafa was already fluent in
												German, it became our middle ground.

												There are also vast cultural differences that required research for me
												to better understand Mostafa. From traditions to religion, so much about
												him was a mystery to me. Having crossed paths in a country foreign to
												both of us, we were on neutral ground when it came to what “normal” was
												to each of us. Our journey together began and progressed because of
												technology.

												Having always taken for granted my luxury of free movement in the world,
												my perspective was dramatically altered by the reality that Mostafa and
												I don’t have the ability to visit each other’s home countries. He’s from
												Syria, which effectively renders him blacklisted from entering the
												United States. For obvious reasons, we are also unable to visit Syria
												together. While we wait for technology to fix wars and terrible policy
												by fostering communication and civilized advancement in leadership,
												Google Earth offers an aerial view for us to reminisce with each other
												and conduct virtual tours together. I won’t be able to introduce him to
												the exciting world of Walmart superstores just yet, but harnessing
												satellite technology makes for a fulfilling Saturday date night.

												Progressing together on the linguistic front included many hours spent
												frantically typing into translator apps to keep the serious conversation
												flowing. My German improved through everyday interaction with Mostafa.
												He also leveled up in English via our hybrid German/English discussions.
												Somewhere in the mix, he began teaching me basic Arabic.

												Enter the magic of YouTube and the bevy of language courses available
												for absolutely free. These resources allowed for our comically formal
												sweet-nothing texts to take a more conversational tone. Gone were the
												days he reminded me by text, “Hello darling, he is now putting clothing
												on his body and will lovingly operate a motor vehicle to your location,”
												to let me know he was driving to me. My response of, “This pleases me.
												When you arrive at my residence we will gather ingredients and make a
												meal,” became human-sounding: “Yay! When you get here we’ll cook
												dinner.” Although nothing takes the place of practicing in person via
												daily necessity, language-learning resources available online were also
												indispensable.

												We eventually became engaged, which transpired through hilariously
												translated conversations meant to be serious. Technical versions of our
												declarations of love were mutually understood. Our wildly different
												cultural and language backgrounds merged to reveal that we’re compatible
												with the universal art of Netflix binges. I’d also finally managed to
												find the movie soulmate I’d longed for who would sweep me off my feet
												with cheesy horror films. Not all partners are cinematically compatible.
												Since we’ve not yet conquered movie theater outings with our mishmashed
												language skills, Netflix lovingly provides us with the choice of
												subtitles and sometimes dubbed versions. We playfully argue over who
												will read a movie, but this feature facilitates our ability to enjoy
												routines together. Discovering Arabic language series and movies —
												including Egyptian melodramas that manage to incorporate musical numbers
												into movies about mobsters — has undoubtedly improved my cinema
												experience.

												We are both interested in politics and world policy as it relates to our
												respective countries. Social media is a valuable tool for learning about
												what’s happening on the ground in Mostafa’s city of Aleppo, Syria. I’ve
												gotten a much better understanding of complexities in the Middle East
												because of his patient explanations. I’ve never had occasion to date
												someone from a conflict zone and I would tend to forget what was going
												on in Syria because it isn’t my home and because our daily lives
												continue uninterrupted and peaceful. Learning about what’s going on in
												Syria through social media is often difficult and heart-wrenching, but I
												don’t look away. I’ve gotten involved with supporting causes for
												refugees through social media by locating organizations both online and
												in Germany. This has impacted my relationship with Mostafa in ways I
												didn’t anticipate, including his overwhelming love for my do-gooding.

												Once we conquered each other and became engaged, it was time for Mostafa
												and me to meet each other’s families. My mother traveled to Germany
												where she met Mostafa for the first time when we went out to dinner. By
												this point, my German was strong enough to translate between Mostafa and
												my mother. Meeting his family was a bit more challenging because our
												relationship transpired on our own terms, not conventional cultural
												norms. Despite this fact, I was welcomed into his family with open arms.
												Conversations between myself and Mostafa’s family are largely through
												texting because we still need translation apps.

												Technology has offered all of us an opportunity to enhance our
												experiences. For my relationship, it made loving someone possible.
												Without it, I would not have found Mostafa or pursued a relationship
												that was against the odds from the start. Searching for connections is
												human nature and something that can’t be outsourced to technology.
												Relationships continue to thrive in the digital era. Though technology
												helped us progress together quickly, but we love completely on our own.

												INTRODUCTION
												Node.js [https://nodejs.org/en/] is a JavaScript runtime environment
												that allows one to run JS on the server. It is built on the open-source
												V8 JavaScript engine [https://developers.google.com/v8/] used in Chrome
												and written in C++ which executes JS in a standalone environment.

												AWS [https://aws.amazon.com/] (Amazon Web Services), a subsidiary of
												Amazon, is a cloud computing platform which provides resources for
												computation such as EC2 instances, various database and storage
												facilities as well as networking and content delivery options.

												Nginx [https://www.nginx.com] is a free and open-source HTTP server
												which doubles up as a reverse proxy server or as a mail proxy server. It
												is a high performance server with simple configuration options and low
												resource consumption.

												EC2 [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/] (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web
												service which provides computing power in the form of scalable server
												instances. Multiple EC2 instances are run on the same machine inside
												Amazon’s computing infrastructure. When an EC2 instance is initiated, a
												set amount of resources (OS, RAM, Disk Space etc., chosen at the time of
												initiation) are allotted to the user from the machine it runs on. This
												allows sharing of resources between multiple users.

												Linux AMI [https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/] is a copy of Linux
												(image) provided by AWS which can be used for free on an EC2 instance as
												an OS. It can contain pre-installed packages such as Python, MySQL,
												Node.js etc., depending on the chosen AMI.

												THINGS TO DO
												1. Create an AWS account
												2. Launch an EC2 instance
												3. SSH into your instance
												4. Install Node.js
												5. Install Git and clone repository from GitHub
												6. Start the node.js app
												7. Keep the app running
												8. Move the app to port 80 (not really)
												9. Configure Nginx to autostart on instance reboot

												CREATE AN AWS ACCOUNT
												Go to AWS [https://aws.amazon.com], click on Create an AWS account. If
												you are already registered, sign in, else create a new account. A new
												account lets you try the free tier for 12 months. Choose Personal
												Account unless you have a business setup for which you will need the
												company details.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*y6Qmrx8juIZS2BFmiVWw_Q.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/993/1*y6Qmrx8juIZS2BFmiVWw_Q.png]Create
												a personal AWS accountYou will have to enter your card details for a
												small refundable charge to verify your identity. Once the registration
												is confirmed, you can go to the console.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qZuA5CjmI1DwtcXMoAxOdA.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1330/1*qZuA5CjmI1DwtcXMoAxOdA.png]AWS
												Service Dashboard (after registration)LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE
												Now that the account is setup, you are ready to launch an EC2 instance.
												Select EC2 from the Services dropdown (top-left), click on Launch
												Instance and select Free Tier Only.

												Linux AMI on an EC2 instance (Free tier)Select Amazon Linux AMI (which
												is usually the first option). On the next screen, select t2.micro (will
												be highlighted as Free tier eligible).

												needed). The next screen might show a warning about the security of the
												instance and changing security group settings. You can ignore this for
												now. The only open port is 22 by default which is used for SSH access to
												the instance. Go ahead and click Launch.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*WLMTWqq0l_R3TQau6czLPw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1352/1*WLMTWqq0l_R3TQau6czLPw.png]Warning

												screen, you will be asked to create a key pair which allows you to SSH
												into your instance. Follow the instructions to create a custom name key
												pair and store it somewhere on your PC where you can access it later and
												in the future too.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*3OGIOsdQrH5Y3oeqlPiDwA.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1356/1*3OGIOsdQrH5Y3oeqlPiDwA.png]Create

												instance to be launched. On the final screen, you can select View
												Instances to go to your EC2 dashboard where you will see the instance up
												and running in a few minutes.

												LaunchedYour EC2 instance will be running now and you will be
												automatically assigned a Public DNS and an IPv4 Public IP which you will
												use to SSH into the instance.

												running on a Public IPSSH INTO YOUR INSTANCE
												Depending on the OS you are using on your PC, there are different
												methods to SSH into your instance. You can see the applicable method by
												clicking on Connect in the above screen. Since I use Windows OS, I use a
												third party SSH client called PuTTY to connect to the instance. You can
												follow the official tutorial
												[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html] on AWS
												docs for using PuTTY as the SSH client.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YU1IfwwsOeV3_y-P3Jy-wA.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/694/1*YU1IfwwsOeV3_y-P3Jy-wA.png]Connect
												to your instanceThe key pair that you saved while creating the EC2
												instance will be used now to connect via SSH. Once you have established
												the connection you will see a terminal similar to this.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*FetfhCxO51g4-U95qHnOkg.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/658/1*FetfhCxO51g4-U95qHnOkg.png]SSH
												connection established with the EC2 instancePUTTY FREQUENT DISCONNECTION
												/ TIMEOUT
												If you use PuTTY, you will see that the terminal frequently becomes
												non-responsive because of a session timeout. You can change the session
												settings to keep the connection alive by going to the category
												Connection of the loaded session and change the value of Seconds between
												keepalives to 30. This will enable sending empty packets to the remote
												server via SSH every 30 seconds to keep the session alive.

												INSTALL NODE.JS
												Now that we are connected to the instance, we can start installing the
												required packages in the environment for your node.js app to work. We
												will be using NVM [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](Node Version
												Manager) to install node.js as it provides a neat way to manage multiple
												node.js versions on the instance if required. Run the following code in
												the terminal to get NVM and install it.

												curl -o-
												https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh |
												bash

												The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source line
												to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).
												Now, run nvm --version. The terminal will show command not found as the
												code has been added to your profile but hasn’t run yet. It runs on every
												login, so login again by creating a new session. Run nvm --version again
												and this time you should be able to see the installed version of NVM.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TAUfBfL3wpbegfnF9h39AA.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/660/1*TAUfBfL3wpbegfnF9h39AA.png]NVM
												installationTo install node, you can either use nvm install node to
												install the latest version of node or use nvm install
												&lt;node_version&gt; to install a specific version of node. Once node is
												installed, you can check the installed version with node --version.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*__x_ULKOa2pQMOFk6DvGqg.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/659/1*__x_ULKOa2pQMOFk6DvGqg.png]Node.js
												installationINSTALL GIT AND CLONE REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB
												We will install Git to clone your node.js repository from your GitHub
												account. To install Git, run the following command.

												sudo yum install git

												This will install the latest version of Git on the instance. Once
												installation is done, you are ready to clone your repository. Run the
												following command to clone your repository. Replace &lt;username&gt;with
												your GitHub username, &lt;repository-name&gt;with the name of your
												node.js app repository and &lt;folder-name&gt;with the name of the
												folder you want to clone the repository into. This folder will be
												created under /home/ec2-user/.

												git clone
												https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository-name&gt;.git
												&lt;folder-name&gt;

												Run cd &lt;folder-name&gt; to move inside this folder and ls to see its
												contents.

												START THE NODE.JS APP
												If your start script does not include npm install you should run it
												manually first, otherwise you can directly issue the command to start
												the app which should install the dependencies automatically. There are
												several ways to start the app depending on how you have set it up.
												Choose one which suits you.

												node server.js
												node app.js
												node ./bin/www
												npm start

												The app will now run at the port number that you have specified in the
												start script. It could be 3000, 8000, 8080 etc. Make a note of this port
												number and enter the public DNS of the instance with the port number in
												the browser to see the app output. I use port 3000, you can replace it
												with yours.

												http://ec2-54-191-104-59.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

												As you will see, this will not work and there would be nothing to show
												on the page and the browser connection will timeout. This is because we
												haven’t opened port 3000 for access to public. This is where the
												Security Group comes in. In the AWS management console, go to Security
												Groups, select the one not named ‘default’ (launch-wizard-1 or similar)
												and edit the Inbound rules.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*07PnlnkoK-24Yb2gbasLyw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1363/1*07PnlnkoK-24Yb2gbasLyw.png]Security
												Groups for the EC2 instanceAdd a new custom TCP rule with port range
												3000 and accessible from everywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*iIlzYZXjFdVTOxYnCm5zWQ.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/997/1*iIlzYZXjFdVTOxYnCm5zWQ.png]Inbound
												rules for the EC2 instanceAccess the URL again and you should be able to
												see the app content now.

												KEEP THE APP RUNNING
												The app will run as long as you have the terminal open and you have not
												stopped it manually. But as soon as you close the terminal or press
												Ctrl-C or its equivalent, the app will stop as its process is not
												running in the background, it’s tied to the active terminal. You can
												write a script to run the process in the background but you will also
												have to take care of restarting the process in the background in case it
												crashes or if you perform a pull from the repository or if you update
												the app in some other way. But there’s an easier way to do all this by
												using a process manager for node called PM2 [http://pm2.keymetrics.io/].
												We will focus on the auto-restart and background process functionalities
												of PM2 here. More functionalities in a later article on continuous
												integration.

												Kill all the running node processes (if any) — killall -9 node. Install
												PM2 globally with the following command:

												npm install pm2 -g

												Move to the cloned folder and execute one of the following commands
												depending on how you had started the app before:

												pm2 start server.js
												pm2 start app.js
												pm2 start ./bin/www
												pm2 start npm --name
												&#34;&lt;name_the_process_anything_you_want&gt;&#34; -- start

												Now even if you close the terminal and check the url in the browser, the
												app will be running. Sweet! For automatically running PM2 when the
												server restarts, issue the following command:

												pm2 startup

												This will output a script in the terminal which you need to run, copy
												the script that it outputs and run it in the terminal window. Now, save
												all the currently running processes so that they can be run again
												whenever PM2 restarts either manually or by a script with the following
												command:

												pm2 save

												Now you can try rebooting the instance and visit the url and see if the
												app works or not. To see a list of the currently active node processes
												with their process names, run pm2 list and to monitor any one of the
												processes run pm2 monit.

												MOVE THE APP TO PORT 80 (NOT REALLY)
												The URL for our app contains the port number 3000 which if you have
												surfed the web a lot will appear a bit out of the place because you
												don’t usually see such numbers in the URLs, reason being the websites
												are generally served on the standard port 80 used for HTTP requests and
												browsers assume it by default.

												Currently our node server is running on a publicly open port which is
												not a particularly brilliant idea as we are directly exposing the
												application server to internet traffic and also reducing performance by
												not taking advantages
												[https://www.nginx.com/blog/5-performance-tips-for-node-js-applications/]
												of load balancing or serving static content efficiently.

												A better way to manage this is to use Nginx as a reverse proxy server in
												front of all other application servers. It will act as an efficient web
												server routing multiple requests on port 80 to different application
												servers based on the requested domain or even route high volume internet
												traffic to the same domain on port 80 to multiple instances of the
												application server listening on different private ports to perform load
												balancing in case of application server overloading or crashing. Nginx
												also takes care of SSL encryption
												[https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/] instead
												of letting Node do all the work.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NFejJ5lJR3nyRLqGicdGbw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/742/1*NFejJ5lJR3nyRLqGicdGbw.png]Setting
												up Nginx in front of the application servers. Image courtesy - Floyd
												Smith
												[https://www.nginx.com/blog/5-performance-tips-for-node-js-applications/]Let’s
												install Nginx first:

												sudo yum install nginx

												and verify the installed version with nginx -v.

												Open port 80 by adding another inbound rule to the security group.

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*vEiEHoHc8Wpihh7DBDiffw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1003/1*vEiEHoHc8Wpihh7DBDiffw.png]Open
												port 80 for public accessEnter the public DNS or the public IP of your
												EC2 instance in the browser now without a port and you should see the
												default Nginx welcome page.

												http://ec2-54-191-104-59.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RbcJHpPp3yYQwjZWRTrYRQ.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/1297/1*RbcJHpPp3yYQwjZWRTrYRQ.png]The
												default Nginx welcome pageNow, we are not really going to move the app
												to listen on port 80, the app will still be running on port 3000. We
												will install Nginx in front of the application server, run it on port 80
												so that it can intercept all internet traffic and route it to port 3000
												where the required application server will be listening if the HTTP
												headers match (more details in the next article on serving the site on
												HTTPS). A nice explanation of why we should be doing this is available
												here [https://stackoverflow.com/a/16770780].

												To use port 80 to route requests to the application server on port 3000,
												we will edit the nginx configuration file — nginx.conf as follows.

												Open the nginx.conf file with an editor in the terminal:

												sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

												If there’s no server block listening on port 80, add one or change it if
												it already exists to look like this:

												server {
												listen 80 default_server;
												listen [::]:80 default_server;
												server_name localhost;
												root /usr/share/nginx/html; location / {
												proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
												proxy_http_version 1.1;
												proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
												proxy_set_header Connection &#39;upgrade&#39;;
												proxy_set_header Host $host;
												proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
												}
												}

												Since we have a single server block listening on port 80, all traffic
												will be routed from here itself regardless of the value of the
												server_name directive. The location directive has been changed to point
												to the resource from where the content has to be served, in our case it
												is the node.js application server running on the private localhost IP
												127.0.0.1 and port 3000. Ignore the other directives for now.

												Save the configuration and restart the server with the following
												command:

												sudo service nginx restart

												You will now have all HTTP traffic available on port 80 forwarded to
												port 3000. You should close port 3000 to public access by removing it
												from the security group settings. Visit the URL again in the browser
												without the port and you will be able to see the app content now instead
												of the default Nginx welcome page.

												CONFIGURE NGINX TO AUTOSTART ON INSTANCE REBOOT
												There’s just one last thing to take care of before we wrap up. We need
												to configure Nginx to start automatically if the instance is rebooted.
												Execute the following command to do this:

												sudo chkconfig nginx on

												You can close the session, reboot the instance and visit the URL again.
												You should see the app being served on port 80.

												And now we are done! Pheww!!




												Since, we have the app being served on port 80 now, we will take care of
												the following stuff in the next article:

												1. Buy and register a domain name
												2. Serve the website on the registered domain
												3. Obtain an SSL certificate for the registered domain
												4. Install the SSL certificate on the server
												5. Run SSL test for the website
												6. Update security parameters on the website
												7. Automatically renew the certificate

												If you are stuck at any point in the sections above or if I have made a
												mistake somewhere or missed an essential point, do let me know in the
												comments.

												Most of us use share host for a very simple web host. Have you ever
												think about how to host a server on the share host and make your node

												# First thing to do:

												wget -qO- https://cdn.rawgit.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | bash

												# Second validate your source file

												source $HOME/.nvm/nvm.shnvm install stable

												# Now check the version of your node and npm

												nvm ls

												You would see something like this:

												Then, go to public_html folder and create htaccess file and

												cd ~/public_htmlnano .htaccess

												# Copy information below, (3000) is the default port for express, change
												whatever port that you are going to setu

												RewriteEngine On

												Once your finish your installation, go to express site to copy some of
												the startup code

												Express &#34;Hello World&#34; exampleThe example above is actually a
												working server: Go ahead and click on the URL shown. You&#39;ll get a
												response, with…expressjs.commkdir myapp
												cd myapp
												npm init -y
												npm install express --save
												touch index.js

												Don’t forget to copy this code to your index.js file:

												const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)
												const app = express()
												const port = 3000app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt;
												res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;))app.listen(port, () =&gt;
												console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))

												Now you are almost compete everything.

												# install the forever start package on your server

												npm i pm2 -g

												Series Manipulation with Pandas
											</a>
										</h3>
										<div class="entry-excerpt">
											<p class="entry-tit">
												As someone who works with time series data on almost a daily basis, I
												have found thepandas
												[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/]Python package to be
												extremely useful for time series manipulation and analysis.

												This basic introduction to time series data manipulation with pandas
												should allow you to get started in your time series analysis. Specific
												objectives are to show you how to:

												* create a date range
												* work with timestamp data
												* convert string data to a timestamp
												* index and slice your time series data in a data frame
												* resample your time series for different time period aggregates/summary
												statistics
												* compute a rolling statistic such as a rolling average
												* work with missing data
												* understand the basics of unix/epoch time
												* understand common pitfalls of time series data analysis

												Let’s get started. If you want to play with real data that you have, you
												may want to start by usingpandas
												[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html]read_csv
												[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html]to
												read in your file to a data frame, however we’re going to start by
												playing with generated data.

												First import the libraries we’ll be working with and then use them
												tocreate a date range

												import pandas as pd
												from datetime import datetime
												import numpy as npdate_rng = pd.date_range(start=&#39;1/1/2018&#39;,
												end=&#39;1/08/2018&#39;, freq=&#39;H&#39;)

												This date range has timestamps with an hourly frequency. If we
												calldate_rngwe’ll see that it looks like the following:

												DatetimeIndex([&#39;2018-01-01 00:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01
												01:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 02:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 03:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 04:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 05:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 06:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 07:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 08:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 09:00:00&#39;,
												...
												&#39;2018-01-07 15:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 16:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 17:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 18:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 19:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 20:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 21:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 22:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 23:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-08 00:00:00&#39;],
												dtype=&#39;datetime64[ns]&#39;, length=169, freq=&#39;H&#39;)

												We can check the type of the first element:

												type(date_rng[0])#returnspandas._libs.tslib.Timestamp

												Let’s create an example data frame with the timestamp data and look at
												the first 15 elements:

												df = pd.DataFrame(date_rng, columns=[&#39;date&#39;])df[&#39;data&#39;]
												= np.random.randint(0,100,size=(len(date_rng)))df.head(15)

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/14/1*iOWtUCR12XLt5IDDehxKnA.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/204/1*iOWtUCR12XLt5IDDehxKnA.png]Example
												data frame — dfIf we want to do time series manipulation, we’ll need to
												have a date time index so that our data frame is indexed on the
												timestamp.

												Convert the data frame index to a datetime indexthen show the first
												elements:

												df[&#39;datetime&#39;] = pd.to_datetime(df[&#39;date&#39;])df =
												df.set_index(&#39;datetime&#39;)df.drop([&#39;date&#39;], axis=1,
												inplace=True)df.head()

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/26/1*9vbzx1FO87ZJapWwXKId2A.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/177/1*9vbzx1FO87ZJapWwXKId2A.png]df
												with datetime indexWhat if our ‘time’ stamps in our data are actually
												string type vs. numerical? Let’s convert ourdate_rngto a list of strings
												and then convert the strings to timestamps.

												string_date_rng = [str(x) for x in
												date_rng]string_date_rng#returns[&#39;2018-01-01 00:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 01:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 02:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 03:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 04:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 05:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 06:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 07:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 08:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 09:00:00&#39;,...

												We canconvert the strings to timestampsby inferring their format, then
												look at the values:

												timestamp_date_rng = pd.to_datetime(string_date_rng,
												infer_datetime_format=True)timestamp_date_rng#returnsDatetimeIndex([&#39;2018-01-01
												00:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 01:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 02:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 03:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 04:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 05:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 06:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 07:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-01 08:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-01 09:00:00&#39;,
												...
												&#39;2018-01-07 15:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 16:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 17:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 18:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 19:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 20:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 21:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-07 22:00:00&#39;,
												&#39;2018-01-07 23:00:00&#39;, &#39;2018-01-08 00:00:00&#39;],
												dtype=&#39;datetime64[ns]&#39;, length=169, freq=None)

												But what about if we need toconvert a unique string format?

												Let’s create an arbitrary list of dates that are strings and convert
												them to timestamps:

												string_date_rng_2 = [&#39;June-01-2018&#39;, &#39;June-02-2018&#39;,
												&#39;June-03-2018&#39;]timestamp_date_rng_2 =
												[datetime.strptime(x,&#39;%B-%d-%Y&#39;) for x in
												string_date_rng_2]timestamp_date_rng_2#returns[datetime.datetime(2018,
												6, 1, 0, 0),
												datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 2, 0, 0),
												datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 3, 0, 0)]

												What does it look like if we put this into a data frame?

												df2 = pd.DataFrame(timestamp_date_rng_2, columns=[&#39;date&#39;])df2

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/27/1*MD2S1B9hTlEPXjeLymyK5w.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/104/1*MD2S1B9hTlEPXjeLymyK5w.png]Going
												back to our original data frame, let’slook at the data by parsing on
												timestamp index:

												Say we just want to see data where the date is the 2nd of the month, we
												could use the index as per below.

												df[df.index.day == 2]

												The top of this looks like:

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/14/1*QcnXFyXnNz7vVqYztH__aw.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/183/1*QcnXFyXnNz7vVqYztH__aw.png]We
												could also directly call a date that we want to look at via the index of
												the data frame:

												df[&#39;2018-01-03&#39;]

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/13/1*jM93ti4vsZaXLnCpWdPweQ.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/182/1*jM93ti4vsZaXLnCpWdPweQ.png]What
												aboutselecting data between certain dates?

												df[&#39;2018-01-04&#39;:&#39;2018-01-06&#39;]

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/13/1*qeBhXKC_SzfAiItiZZopFQ.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/178/1*qeBhXKC_SzfAiItiZZopFQ.png]The
												basic data frame that we’ve populated gives us data on an hourly
												frequency, but we canresample the data at a different frequencyand
												specify how we would like to compute the summary statistic for the new
												sample frequency. We could take the min, max, average, sum, etc., of the
												data at a daily frequency instead of an hourly frequency as per the
												example below where we compute the daily average of the data:

												df.resample(&#39;D&#39;).mean()

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/16/1*EAMBuYLGbnQOssQ5iKhh7Q.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/155/1*EAMBuYLGbnQOssQ5iKhh7Q.png]What
												aboutwindow statistics such as a rolling mean or a rolling sum?

												Let’s create a new column in our original df that computes the rolling
												sum over a 3 window period and then look at the top of the data frame:

												df[&#39;rolling_sum&#39;] = df.rolling(3).sum()
												df.head(10)

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/23/1*tjMO67HZ4j2HA-d3VR063Q.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/253/1*tjMO67HZ4j2HA-d3VR063Q.png]We
												can see that this is computing correctly and that it only starts having
												valid values when there are three periods over which to look back.

												This is a good chance to see how we can doforward or backfilling of data
												when working with missing data values.

												Here’s our df but with a new column that takes the rolling sum and
												backfills the data:

												df[&#39;rolling_sum_backfilled&#39;] =
												df[&#39;rolling_sum&#39;].fillna(method=&#39;backfill&#39;)
												df.head(10)

												[https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*8EtGaf4aiSBAay9lZfAl8A.png?q=20][https://miro.medium.com/max/401/1*8EtGaf4aiSBAay9lZfAl8A.png]It’s
												often useful to be able to fill your missing data with realistic values
												such as the average of a time period, but always remember that if you
												are working with a time series problem and want your data to be
												realistic, you shouldnotdo a backfill of your data as that’s like
												looking into the future and getting information you would never have at
												that time period. Likely you will want to forward fill your data more
												frequently than you backfill.

												When working with time series data, you may come across time values that
												are in Unix time. Unix time, also called Epoch time is the number of
												seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time
												(UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970. Using Unix time helps to disambiguate
												time stamps so that we don’t get confused by time zones, daylight
												savings time, etc.

												Here’s an example of a time t that is in Epoch time andconverting
												unix/epoch time to a regular time stamp in UTC:

												epoch_t = 1529272655
												real_t = pd.to_datetime(epoch_t,
												unit=&#39;s&#39;)real_t#returnsTimestamp(&#39;2018-06-17 21:57:35&#39;)

												If I wanted toconvert that time that is in UTC to my own time zone, I
												could simply do the following:

												real_t.tz_localize(&#39;UTC&#39;).tz_convert(&#39;US/Pacific&#39;)#returnsTimestamp(&#39;2018-06-17
												14:57:35-0700&#39;, tz=&#39;US/Pacific&#39;)

												With these basics, you should be all set to work with your time series
												data.

												Here are afew tips to keep in mind and common pitfalls to avoid when
												working with time series data:

												* Check for discrepanciesin your data that may be caused by region
												specific time changes like daylight savings time.
												* Keep track of time zonesmeticulously — let others going through your
												code know what time zone your data is in, and think about converting to
												UTC or a standardized value in order to keep your data standardized.
												* Missing data can occur frequently — make sure youdocument your
												cleaning rulesand think about not backfilling information you wouldn’t
												have been able to have at the time of a sample.
												* Remember that as you resample your data or fill in missing values,
												you’re losing a certain amount of information about your original data
												set. I’d suggestkeeping track of all of your data transformationsand
												tracking the root cause of your data issues.
												* When you resample your data, the best method (mean, min, max, sum,
												etc.) will be dependent on the kind of data you have and how it was
												sampled.Be thoughtful about how you resample your datafor your analysis.
